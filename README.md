TICTACTOE.JS
===============

Plays a game of tic-tac-toe using Canvas and Javascript. AI being used is a negamax variant of minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

AI Algorithm
------------
At worst the AI will draw a tie against any opponent. However you can replace the version of the AI using negamax alpha-beta pruning with an AI that just randomly picks an open space.

To change this change the call in tictactoe.js from:

system.alphaBetaSearch(system.board(),-whoseTurn ) 

To this method.

system.chooseRandom(system.board(),-whoseTurn ) 

TODO
------------
This is pretty much complete although some cleanup in tictactoe.js would be nice. Maybe add an option in the interface to allow the user to choose between the negamax/alpha-beta pruning and the random AI.
